# Daylight
An app with talks to [Sunbeam](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/sunbeam) and stages all your data before yeeting to the FEC. Basically, [FECFile](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/fecfile-software/), but without the whole Microsoft Cancer and more fun. Named after [Daylight](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/track/1fzAuUVbzlhZ1lJAx9PtY6?si=ae07773500bb443e).

_To the FEC: Yes, I am aware that I am applying to build an application and not just submit an FEC report_
